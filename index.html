<!-- 		<p>
      I am a <strong style='color: grey;'>Senior Data Scientist</strong> interested in creatively applying engineering and data science to solve real world problems. I graduated with a degree in computer science from the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University and currently work as a data scientist at the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/al-johri/">Washington Post</a>.
    </p>
		<p>
      I have solid core programming skills and a strong grasp on the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms and web programming. I am always thinking about system design, scalability, optimization, and testing. I love to participate in hackathons and work on projects using machine learning to find hidden insights in data. Please take a moment to look at my <a href="projects/"> projects</a> or send me an email for a full resume.

    <p>
    I'm a <strong style='color: grey;'>Senior Data Scientist</strong> at the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/al-johri/">Washington Post</a> where I create data products to help news stories reach the broadest possible audience. I've worked on subscription propensity models, reccomendation engines, article classifiers, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/robots-wrote-this-story/">Heliograf</a>, an automated story generator. I'm a big believer in human-in-the-loop systems and am always thinking about the ethical implications of my work.
    </p>

    <p>
    I am a hacker, maker, journalist, and civic technologist with a particular interest in natural language processing and machine learning. I am passionate about collaborating on open-source projects and building open-source communities.
    </p>

    <p>
    I have worked on every level of the stack, from system level code to the css box model, which helps me quickly remove blockers when working in a team and build end-to-end products when working alone. I pay close attention to optimziation and scaling, and write clean, containerized, applications with simple documentation that are quick to deploy. When I'm not putzing away at a keyboard, I enjoy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGbX1VpwCc0">singing</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O0Vj8zYv7aI">Indian</a> classical music, playing with hardware and electronics, and eating tacos.
