		<p> I am a software engineer interested in creatively applying engineering and data science to solve real world problems. I recently graduated with a degree in computer science from the McCormick School of Engineering at Northwestern University.</p>
		<p> I have solid core programming skills and a strong grasp on the fundamentals of data structures, algorithms and web programming. I am always thinking about system design, scalability, optimization, and testing. I love to participate in hackathons and work on projects using machine learning to find hidden insights in data. Please take a moment to look at my <a href="projects/"> projects</a> or send me an email for a full resume.</p>
