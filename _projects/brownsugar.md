description: At Northwestern University, I had the pleasure of participating in a South Asian Interest A Capella group, Brown Sugar. I had the opportunity to solo in two songs on our 4th studio album, [Zamaane](https://open.spotify.com/album/1zI4ucXbzfjCK2u2EGq7In). The first song is a mix of Bin Tere (translates to Without You) by Shafqat Amanat Ali and Without You by David Guetta. The second song is Minds Without Fear by Imogen Heap.
